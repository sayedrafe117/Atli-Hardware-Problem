SQL: Finance and Supply Chain Analytics Project! ðŸŒŸ

Let's take a look without any further due!

ðŸŽ¯ Mission:
Atliq Hardware has launched a project to address performance issues arising from the expansion of Excel files. To combat this challenge, the company wanted a team of data analysts who would leverage MySQL as their database and help analyze data, extract valuable insights and gain an understanding of the company's financial position. The primary objective is to enhance decision-making and elevate overall performance.

ðŸ›  Approach
There were some requirements for AtliQ like : 
1. Product Wise Sales Report for Croma in 2021
2. Monthly Gross Sales Report for Croma
3. Yearly Gross Sales Report for Croma
4. Top n Customers by Net Sales
5. Top Markets by Net Sales
6. Supply Chain Analytics Report for the year 2021
7. Forecast Accuracy Report (2020 vs 2021)

To tackle the above requirements, I used MySQL as my database platform. I dug into data on market shifts and how customers behave. I formulated SQL queries and this helped me give insights to AtliQ on what influences buying decisions and how to better connect with customers.
